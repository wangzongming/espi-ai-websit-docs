        icon: twemoji:balance-scale
        title: Concise & Comprehensive
        details: Developers will never have to learn an extra new concept or write code irrelevant to the business. The client supports development environments such as Arduino, IDF (under implementation), and PlatformIO.
      -
        icon: twemoji:card-file-box
        title: Plug - in Architecture
        details: Built - in IAT, TTS, and LLM from iFLYTEK, ByteDance, and Alibaba Cloud. Other platforms can be extended through plugins.
      -
        icon: flat-color-icons:voice-presentation
        title: Multiple Interaction & Wake - up Methods
        details: Customizable offline voice wake - up. Voice inference uses TensorFlow Lite models. An online wake - word generation service will be launched in the future. It supports continuous conversation, push - to - talk, or any other conversation mode.
      -
        icon: openmoji:authority-instruction
        title: Command Recognition
        details: Developers can customize user commands or use built - in commands to enable robots to control home appliances, sing, etc.
      -
        icon: twemoji:laptop-computer
        title: C/S Architecture
        details: The server and client are separated. Complex calculations and service scheduling are all handled by the server, greatly reducing the cost of the client and providing services to N clients simultaneously.
      -
        icon: twemoji:locked-with-key
        title: Identity Authentication
        details: Identity verification of the client can be performed when each client connects and during each session.
      -
        icon: twemoji:rocket
        title: Real - time Response
        details: All service interfaces use the `WebScoket` protocol for streaming transmission, ensuring real - time server response. Every character inferred by the LLM can be immediately sent to the user.
      -
        icon: icon-park:config
        title: Configurable
        details: Except for plugins written for special businesses, the configurations provided by the framework or plugins can generally meet most scenarios.
      -
        icon: icon-park:strongbox
        title: Production - ready & Integratable
        details: As a development library released for production environments, ESP - AI has strict requirements for scalability, flexibility, and stability. It can be easily integrated into existing projects.
