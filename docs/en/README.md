features: 
  - title: Simplicity First
    details: Whether it's hardware code, server-side code, or plugin development, developers won't need to learn new concepts or write unnecessary code.

  - title: Flexible Expansion
    details: The framework only includes iFLYTEK's IAT, TTS, and LLM by default. For other platforms, plugins can be downloaded from the plugin market as needed, or developers can easily create their own plugins.

  - title: Voice Activation
    details: Customizable offline voice activation with voice inference using TensorFlow Lite models. An online wake word generation service will be available in the future.

  - title: Command Recognition
    details: Developers can customize user commands or use built-in commands to enable the robot to control home appliances, sing, and more.

  - title: C/S Architecture
    details: The server and client are separated. The server supports multiple clients connecting simultaneously and provides services to all connected clients.

  - title: Identity Authentication
    details: Each client connection and session can undergo identity verification and other operations.

  - title: Real-time Response
    details: All service interfaces use the WebSocket protocol for streaming transmission, enabling real-time server response. Each character inferred by LLM is responded to in real time.

  - title: Configurable & Zero Code
    details: Apart from plugins written for special business needs, the configurations provided by the framework or plugins generally meet most scenarios. A configuration generation service will be offered in the future, making it completely zero-code.

  - title: Production grade & integrable
    details: ESP-AI is a development library released for production environments, with strict requirements for scalability, flexibility, and stability.
