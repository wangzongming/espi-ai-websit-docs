If you can't solve your problem through documentation, search engines, GitHub Issue searches, etc., you can get technical support through the following methods.

## Free Technical Support
- Submit your problem via GitHub Issues. This is free and is the most recommended way. Since the issues are public, it can help more people and avoid duplicate questions.
- Join the QQ group (group number: 854445223) and ask others if they have encountered the same problem or if they have a solution.
- If you are familiar with <a href="https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/25258228"> "The Art of Asking Questions"</a>, respect the other person's time, and can clearly describe your problem, including the operating environment, troubleshooting process, etc., then add my WeChat xiaomingdijia to contact me. I will try to help you solve the problem. This is free, but I recommend that you submit your problem through <a href="https://github.com/wangzongming/esp-ai/issues">GitHub Issues</a>.

## Paid Technical Support
`ESP - AI` is a large new ecosystem. For the sustainable development of the project, we also provide paid technical support. 
If you want a faster response and don't want to search or can't understand those things, you can pay for technical support.
