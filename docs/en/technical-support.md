# Technical Support

If you can't solve your problem through documentation, search engines, GitHub Issues search, etc., you can get technical support through the following methods.

## Free Technical Support

- Submit your issue through GitHub Issues. This is free and highly recommended because the issues are public, which can help more people and avoid repeated problems.
- Join the QQ group to ask others if they have encountered the same issue or if they have a solution.
- If you are familiar with <a href="https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/25258228">"The Art of Asking Questions"</a> and know how to respect others' time, you can clearly describe your problem, including the runtime environment and troubleshooting process. Then, add me on WeChat (xiaomingdijia) to contact me. I will try to help you solve the problem for free, but I still recommend you to submit issues through GitHub Issues.

## Paid Technical Support

`ESP-AI` is a large open-source project. For sustainable development, we also offer paid technical support.

If you want faster responses and don't want to search or can't understand the available information, you can pay for technical support. You can contact me via QQ: 1746809408 or WeChat: xiaomingdijia and explain your request.
